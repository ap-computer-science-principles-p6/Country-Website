<center><h2>Global Impact</h2></center>
<font face="times" color="#000000" size="=+3">
 <p>The Drug ATM changed the world because it created a medication collection point with a drastically shorter waiting time. It has provided a more convenient and cheap method to acquire medication. They are especially useful in less developed locations containing overcrowded healthcare facilities since many people in those areas suffer from chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS. One negative effect Drug ATMs have is the possibility of replacing pharmaceutical jobs. The Drug ATM has also increased drug addiction rates and the rate of theft for drugs due to the many people having the intention to abuse the drugs. </p>

<p> The global impact of the first Human to human heart transplant done by Christiaan Barnard was that a new wave of research into heart to heart transplants was done. This allowed for many people suffering from uncurable heart diseases to have a new chance at surviving. This also allowed for the practice to reach the level of saturation in the medical field that it has reached now globally. </p>
