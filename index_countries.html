<font face="times" color="#000000" size="=+3">
 <p>The Drug ATM changed the world because it created a medication collection point with a drastically shorter waiting time. It has provided a more convenient and cheap method to acquire medication. They are especially useful in less developed locations containing overcrowded healthcare facilities since many people in those areas suffer from chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS. One negative effect Drug ATMs have is the possibility of replacing pharmaceutical jobs. The Drug ATM has also increased drug addiction rates and the rate of theft for drugs due to the many people having the intention to abuse the drugs. </p>
