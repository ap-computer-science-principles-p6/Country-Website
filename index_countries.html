<font face="times" color="#000000" size="=+3">
 <p>The Drug ATM changed the world because it created a medication collection point with a drastically shorter waiting time. It has provided a more convenient and efficient method to acquire medication. They are useful in less developed locations containing overcrowded healthcare facilities. Many people in those areas suffer from chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS which incereases its practicality. One negative effect Drug ATMs have is the possibility of replacing pharmaceutical jobs. It promotes generic medication, which has saved the public money. This has increased drug addiction rates and violence around locations providing a Drug ATM due to the intention of abusing the drugs. </p>
