<h1>The Human to Human Heart Transplant</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<img src="ChristiaanBarnard.jpg" class="center" alt="Christiaan Barnard" width="25%">
<p>The operating surgeon to perform the first human to human heart transplant was South African Native, Christiaan Barnard. He was born on November 8th, 1922 in Beaufort West, South Africa. He studied medicine and experimented on dogs, trying to find a cure for intestinal atresia, a congenial malformation that causes bowel obstruction. <br> <br> In 1958, Barnard was named the head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital. In 1967, he performed the second kidney transplant in South Africa and cemented his dominance as the premier organ transplant surgeon in the country. </p>

<h2>The Procedure</h2>

<p>The procedure occured in the early morning of December 3rd, 1967. The patient was Louis Washkansky, who was a patient struggling to survive diabetes and incurable heart disease. The heart that was transplanted came from Denise Darvall, who was pronoucned brain dead from a car accident. Barnard was in the operation theater for five hours and was helped by his brother and 30 staff members. The technological innovation came when Barnard modified two prior transplant techniques: the Shumway and Lower Technique. Instead of the prior techniques that had not yielded successful results, he avoided damage to the septum and cut two holes, one for the venae cavae and another for the pulmonary veins. Barnard injected potassium into the victim's heart in order to paralyze it. The transplant was deemed a success even though the patient lived for a mere 18 days prior to dying from pneumonia from the immunisuppressive drugs. </p>

<h2>Wide Spread Effects of the Innovation </h2>

<p> The new practice pioneered by Christiaan Barnard revolutionized the entire medical field. In 1968, approximately 100 transplants were performed worldwide with the technique pioneered by Barnard. Barnard saw the technological improvement of the new process and advocated heavily for the improvement of immunosuppressive drugs. This lead to the creation of cyclosporine which helped Bernard's technique gain popularity around the world. </p>
