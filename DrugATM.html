  <p>TEST. TEST. TEST. The Pharmacy Dispensing Unit (PDU) provides medicine similar to how an ATM provides money. First, it scans a barcode or a pharmacy card, then it receives the PIN entered in by the user and starts a Skype call to discuss the patient conditions. The medication is labeled and then dispensed after the consultation, and the follow-up appointment is as indicated on the receipt.</p>

  <p>The PDU allows for fewer trips to the pharmacy because it dispenses a larger amount of medication (two months’ worth) in one transaction. <br>Its cloud-based system provides more insight into the medical records of the South African public due to the data it collects. This data is useful because it is not found in the paper records of the public healthcare system.</p>

  <p>A reoccuring problem in South Africa is the overcrowding of clinics resulting in long waiting hours. The PDU drastically speeds up the process for a patient to receive their medication by reducing the waiting period and presecribing medication more effectively. It is more widely available as it is open on weekends and holidays, and it is open longer than usual clinics. These PDUs are often located closer to residents which will also save them transportation time.</p>

  <p>One downside to the PDU is its lack of access to various types of medication. It is limited to HIV, diabetes, asthma, and some others, but it could be expanded in the furture to accommodate for malaria or common flu medication. As of now, there are too few PDUs to be able to impact South Africa considerably, and the availability of the medications the PDU houses is limited. </p></tr>
